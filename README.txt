To run the program, have only one webcam plugged-in to your computer and execute with python3.5 (python2 will not work) “run.py”. Ex: “python3 run.py”.

Run this program with optimal light conditions, with the the face in a frontal-face position pointing directly at the webcam. Move the whole head left, right, up, and down, while keeping the frontal-face parallel to the camera (i.e., keep the face straight in respect to the camera.)

When wishing to exit, press the escape key on the facial detection screen (where your video feed is showing) and “x” out of the cursor pane, or simply do a ctrl+c in the terminal in which the program is being executed…killing the process.
